\section{What I've done}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Started disassembling UAV (everything I could do without a screwdriver. Motors can remain attached to arms.)}
\item{Had a chat with Jean-Luc about what the UAV will end up as (as close to his as possible but with a different frame to try to increase dampening -- need to ask Alex about the frame)}
\item{Emailed Alex about induction, should hopefully get this done in the next few days}
\item{Started filling in the project proposal form (see attched)}
\end{itemize}

\section{Parts of report to look at}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Outline - can just have a look at the title page and the contents (page 2)}
\end{itemize}

\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Any suggested papers?}
\item{Should I put things like model names for frames/where we bought them in my report? If so, who should I ask for this information?}
\end{itemize}

\section{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Apparently the TX2 is in, so I should be able to use that for the UAV}
\item{Need to fill in project proposal form (due 16th March -- end of week 4). Have attached a copy that I have started filling in.}
\item{Mid-semester report due Friday 25 May, 2018 (only 4 pages)}
\end{itemize}
